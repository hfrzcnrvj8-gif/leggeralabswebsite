// collapsed mark, instead of depending on how wide the surrounding box
// happens to be at that moment. A flat color, not a gradient: a 0%→100%
// gradient painted across one narrow glyph shows internal banding (part
// purple, part gold within the same letter) instead of reading as a
// single clean hue — same reason the echo "L" below uses a flat
// `color-mix()` result instead of its own little gradient.

/**
 * `progress` is a 0→1 scroll-linked MotionValue (see Header.tsx), the same
 * pattern as the Hero orb parallax and the Showcase window's width grow —
 * NOT a boolean toggle. The wordmark shrinks in place continuously as you
 * scroll: "EGGERA"/" "/"ABS"/"." collapse their own width+opacity together,
 * while the second "L" slides into a tight offset behind the first,
 * forming the same mark as LogoMark.
 *
 * "EGGERA"/"ABS"/"." share ONE gradient/background-clip:text on the outer
 * span so the color reads as a single continuous sweep. The second "L"
 * gets its own fixed flat gold color instead (see `secondLStyle`) so it
 * stays reliably distinct from the purple echo once collapsed — it sits
 * at the gold end of the shared sweep anyway, so this doesn't create a
 * visible seam in the expanded phrase. Its offset uses `marginLeft` +
 * `verticalAlign` only (plain layout, safe).
 *
 * The first "L" (the faded echo) can NOT fade via `opacity`: any
 * descendant of a background-clip:text element that gets `opacity < 1`
 * is promoted to its own compositing layer, and since that descendant has
 * no background-image of its own, the isolated layer paints empty — the
 * letter silently disappears even though every computed style looks
 * correct. Confirmed by isolating it in an overlay: two plain sibling
 * spans both render, but the moment either one gets `opacity`, that one
 * (and only that one) vanishes. Fix: fade it with a flat `color-mix()`
 * result on the plain `color` property instead — no gradient, no
 * background-clip, so there's nothing for an isolated layer to lose.
 * Blended toward a fixed dark neutral rather than `var(--bg)`: mixing
 * purple with the light theme's warm cream shifts the perceived hue
 * toward pale pink, while blending toward a constant dark tone reads as
 * purple in both themes.
